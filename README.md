# GitHub-Profiler-API

## GitHub-Profiler-API is a simple API built in Flask. It allows  you to get basic information about GitHub users, and the languages they use in their repositories, in a very simple and clear way.

This project is a recruitment task I received at the beginning of my journey with programming, and at that time, I wasn't able to do it. Now, after some time, I decided to go back to this task, and it turned out to be very simple.

## Running the API

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Flask: 'pip install flask'.
3. Run the API: 'python main.py'.
4. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. Follow instructions

## Example output of the API:
